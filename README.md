# MachineCodeVM
 This is based on an idea of using machine-code style operations instead of matrices math. This is an idea I've played around with for the past few years, and I decided to write it to its rational extreme.
 the main flaw I've noticed while running this, is that the barrier between not functioning at all, and giving an evaluatable output is minimal. 
 
 ### PAQ(possibly asked questions)
 - Q. If this is supposed to be performance-heavy, why isn't it written in a lower-level language like C++?
   - A. This is one to two steps away from being pseudo code. It's really more of a proof of concept than useable code.

- Q. If this is a proof of concept, why isn't this written in Python?
  - A. I write too much Python already and felt like using Go more.
